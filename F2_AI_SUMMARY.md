  - Focus on growth and compounding
  - Example: "At 22, you have decades to ride out volatility..."

- **Middle-Aged (31-50)**:
  - 55-70% equity
  - Balance growth and preservation
  - Example: "At 40, balancing career earnings with future needs..."

- **Pre-Retirement (51-65)**:
  - 35-50% equity
  - Capital protection, income generation
  - Example: "At 58, protecting accumulated wealth..."

- **Retired (65+)**:
  - 20-35% equity
  - Stability, dividends, low volatility
  - Example: "In retirement, steady income is paramount..."

  2. Portfolio rationale with specific stock mentions
  3. Performance metrics in context
  4. Forward guidance and rebalancing tips
